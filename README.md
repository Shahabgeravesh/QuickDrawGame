## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Prompts

Edit `data/prompts.ts` to add new categories and words:

```typescript
{
  category: 'Your Category',
  words: ['Word1', 'Word2', 'Word3']
}
```

### Adjusting Game Settings

Modify game settings in `context/GameContext.tsx`:

```typescript
settings: {
  roundDuration: 60,    // Drawing time in seconds
  roundsPerGame: 3,     // Number of rounds per game
}
```

## 📣 AdMob (Expo)

AdMob is configured via environment variables and the Expo config file.

**Where IDs are set**
- Expo config: `app.config.js` uses `ADMOB_ANDROID_APP_ID` and `ADMOB_IOS_APP_ID`
- Ad unit ID: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_ID` (used in `services/AdService.ts`)
- Test devices: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_TEST_DEVICE_IDS` (comma-separated)

**Switch test vs production**
- Development builds use Google test ads automatically.
- Production builds require `EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_ID` to be set.

**Rebuild when IDs change**
```bash
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
```

> Ads do not load in Expo Go. Use a development build or EAS build.

## 🚢 Building for Production

### iOS

1. Configure your app in `app.config.js`
2. Build with EAS:
```bash
eas build --platform ios
```

3. Submit to App Store:
```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

## 🎯 Apple Arcade Considerations

To prepare for Apple Arcade submission:

1. **No IAP/Ads**: Ads are enabled in this project. Remove AdMob for Apple Arcade.
2. **Premium Quality**: Focus on polish, animations, and user experience
3. **Unique Features**: Consider adding:
   - Online multiplayer support
   - Custom word lists
   - Drawing replay feature
   - Achievement system
   - More game modes

4. **Performance**: Optimize for smooth 60fps gameplay
5. **Accessibility**: Add VoiceOver support and accessibility labels
6. **Localization**: Support multiple languages
